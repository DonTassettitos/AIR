   NEXMark Generator -- Niagara Extension to XMark Data Generator

   Acknowledgements:
   The NEXMark Generator was developed using the xmlgen generator 
   from the XMark Benchmark project as a basis. The NEXMark
   generator generates streams of auction elements (bids, items
   for auctions, persons) as opposed to the auction files
   generated by xmlgen.  xmlgen was developed by Florian Waas.
   See http://www.xml-benchmark.org for information.
